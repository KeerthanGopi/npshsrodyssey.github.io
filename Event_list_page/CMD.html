							<p>Introduction:</br>
							CMD:/ is a computational coding event that tests the participants knowledge in math, and programming in the guise of a card game. Teams will face off in a battle that tests their wit and luck. In this card game, ​When a question card is matched with an appropriate answer card, that question-answer pair is to be discarded.Each team is given a hand of 20 cards, 10 of which are question cards and the rest answer cards. Teams can exchange cards blindy between themselves and thus have a chance at removing unwanted cards and get wanted cards. The team with no cards remaining in their hand win.The questions asked will be of medium difficulty and will be computational i.e they will have a numerical answer but not a general solution. </p>
							<p>Topics tested:</br>

							Basic math</br>

							Knowledge of the standard library of the programming language</br>

							Logic</p>
							<p>Rules and Guidelines:</br>

							Each team is given a hand of 20 cards, 10 of which are question cards and the rest answer cards.</br>

							When a question card is matched with an appropriate answer card, that question-answer pair is to be discarded.</br>

							The team with no cards remaining in their hand win.</br>

							The questions asked will be of medium difficulty and will be computational i.e they will have a numerical answer but not a general solution.</br>

							Questions can be coded in any programming language. *</br>

							Unlike a normal card game this will not be turn-based.</br>

							Teams can exchange cards blindy between themselves. They have a chance at removing unwanted cards and get wanted cards.</br>

							There is also a global stack of cards from which teams can pull cards from if they are in need of cards. (subject to dry run)</br>

							In the event a team can’t answer a question, they can give away that question card, but they will be in “card debt”. The only way to clear card debt is to make two correct question answer pairs.</br>

							There is a special type of card called the pseudo code card. These cards contain snippets of code like: ‘print’ and ‘“Hello World”’. For example, if the cards containing the aforementioned code snippets can be ordered into a meaningful piece of code, the pseudo cards can be exchanged for ‘CPU time’. ‘CPU time’ is like a currency system that can be exchanged for commands that can change the tide of game. An example for a command: ‘Force an exchange between any 2 teams’.(subject to dry run)</p>
							<p>Requirements from school:</br>
							● Computers in the computer lab, around 10.</br>

							General Information:</br>
							● Venue:</br>
							- The computer lab.</br>
							● Details about Participants:</br>
							- The event is team based; 2 people in one team.</br>
							- Participants need not to bring their own laptops for the event.</br>
							● Time required:</br>
							- 10:00 to 12:00</br>
							● No volunteers required; 1 if really necessary</br>
							● No judges</br>
							● Merit prizes: 1st team to empty their hand gets first place etc.</br>
							Example questions</br>
							● P(n) is an iterative sequence as defined as below:</br>
							if n is even -> n/2</br>
							if n is odd -> 3n+1</br>
							if n is 1 stop</br>
							P(13) => 13->40->20->10->5->16->8->4->2->1</br>
							Which number under a million makes the largest sequence?</br>
							● Factorial of n is the product of the first n natural numbers.</br>
							Primorial of n is the product of the first n prime numbers.</br>
							The nth euclid number is the primorial of n + 1.</br>
							Which is the 15th(10th) euclid number?</br>
							* Please note that our computer systems only support Python, Java, and C++. If any team
							wants to use any other language, they have to contact us and only if we are allowed to install
							that language on our school’s computer systems, we can let them participate.</p>
