							<p>The event is as straightforward as it gets, the comedian who makes the judges and audience laugh the most is the better man. The entire event will consist of two rounds…</p>
							<p>Stage 1:</br>
							The first round of the event is an open end challenge. This means that the participants will know their topics beforehand, i.e. 3 days prior to the fest. The round will be a face off battle between every two participants, which means two participants will get the same topic and have to speak on it. Assuming there are ten participant schools in the first round, then 5 topics and each topic goes to two schools.
							The 3 judges will mark both opponents out of 10. After adding all marks, whichever person gets more marks out of 30 will win and qualify for the next round whereas the loser gets knocked out immediately. This means 5 out of the earlier ten participants will qualify for the final round.
							</p>
							<p>Stage 2:</br>
							The grand finale, here the remaining five people get topics on the spot, more like we put them in real life situations and they have to bring the humor to it. For instance, the results of the exams have been declared but the student has performed badly and has not yet told their parents and the result gets uploaded on the pupil pod, now what they do to make it funny. The participants pick a chit each and have to speak on the scenario they get. Again the comedians are rated out of 300 and whoever amongst the 5 remaining gets highest marks wins, but here marking will be stricter.
							</p>
							<p>Additional Information:</br>
							Ø In round 1, each person gets about three minutes to speak</br>
							Ø In round 2, if we are giving one topic per person then 5 mins preparation time plus 3 minutes to speak.</br>
							Ø Both rounds have a break of 10 mins</br>
							Ø Negative marking for exceeding time limit by more than 30 seconds.</br>
							Ø No usage of inappropriate language.</br>
							Ø A couple of words of a language other than English are allowed.</br>
							Ø Also, we would need an obedient and behaved audience that can understand and appreciate the jokes cracked (basically laugh), and judges to give points.</br>
							Ø Most importantly, we need a place where the event can be conducted smoothly. The mini auditorium would be the most ideal place because the comedians would need a proper stage to perform on, they need mikes and speakers, and there is proper seating arrangement for the audience too. Most importantly, in round 1, where the participants will have a face off, they can’t hear what their opponents are speaking, because they have the same topic, so we can conveniently send the other participant outside the Mini Audi.</br>
							We expect the event to last for two hours at max.</br>
